Q1) Why are you interested in taking Data Science?

“Data Science is not only about finding the answers, it is also about asking the right questions”. This subject was introduced to me during my third semester of under graduation, and I was intrigued by this subject mainly because it was based on the foundation of Mathematics and Python Programming. Learning about Business intelligence and Data Analytics to make data driven decisions has led me to dive deeper into the realm of data science and machine learning and contribute in the tech industry of this ever evolving world of data.
